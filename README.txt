Yukkuri Bumper

There are two sumo wrestlers that resemble the deformed faces of Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisami from the Touhou series.
The two of them are fighting over the large pile of desserts that will be awarded to the winner.

Each player wants to push the other out of the ring.  There are pick-ups that make you bigger/faster.  Items are thrown in from off-stage.  You can sacrifice size for speed/pushing power. There will be multiple stages with various stage hazards and effects, such as moving platforms, pitfalls, and danger zones.

The game will be entirely physics based, which 'movement' only adding force to the direction the player wants to move.
The players will each be represented by a round, blob-like rigid body. Some arenas will have a clearly defined 'danger zone'
where a flow field will push the players around helplessly.

The experience of the game depends on your opponent.

We plan on having the basic movement, food interaction, arena, and win/lose condition by the second week. For the third
week, we plan on adding complexity to the arenas, player interactions, and food spawning. The fourth week will be spent
on finishing touches. The fifth week will be spent on polish.
